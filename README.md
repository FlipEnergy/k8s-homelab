# Dennis' Homelab k8s playground
Just repo that holds stuff for my personal homelab k8s environment. There's a lot of encrypted files for storing my secrets in addition to override values files for helm charts.

A lot of the charts I use are from [k8s-at-home](https://github.com/k8s-at-home/charts) and I'm now also a contributer there.
